I purchased my first one back in 1999.  Thirteen years later, I am still impressed with this awesome jacket.  The good news is that I have really put this jacket to the test.  The better news is that it is everything I had hoped it would be and then some.Using this jacket on numerous winter cold weather expeditions in Alaska, Northern Rockies and even in the Canadian Arctic it has had ample opportunity to disappoint.  It has never dissapointed me.  In my line of work, I spend several weeks (3-5) at a time in the wilderness in cold climates, the last thing I want to be worrying about is staying warm.  This jacket has taken more abuse than most people will be able to dish out in a lifetime.  It still has many serviceable years in it.  I wear it as a mid-layer under my Gore-Tex shell and over my Patagonia expedition weight capilene, or on milder days 20's - 30's I simply use it without the Gore-Tex shell.  The jacket is more stiff than you would expect when new, but becomes quite supple with a few washings.  The windproof membrane is absolutely essential in a fleece jacket.  In cool/cold windy conditions a fleece jacket is useless as outerwear without the windproofing membrane.I recently purchased another Patagonia Retro X...not because my 1st one is worn out, but simply because I saw it at a price that I couldn't refuse.  Even at full retail this jacket is must have for me.  Comfortable, warm, functional and quality workmanship in a very durable, lightweight garment.  What more could a person want in a jacket?\", '6_jacket_layer_patagonia (0.641)']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"idG6lD30F-0L","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"b4e9682f-63ec-4653-98a4-518477c71335","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1581392695394,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1002082,"user":{"displayName":"Nick Cottrell","photoUrl":"","userId":"11106463128379382840"}}},"source":["#save classifications to an xls file\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount = True)\n","documentclassification.to_excel('drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Topic Modeling project/patagonia_topic_classification2.xlsx')"],"execution_count":43,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
